**Your page shoould be focused on this prompt**: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript all help to create different parts of our web experience. What is an apt metaphor for describing the roles of each of these technologies and how they work together?

Your document should contain semantic HTML and CSS while addressing the prompt above in no less than 500 words.

## Deliverables
